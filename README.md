# Fatal Frame 3 / Zero ~Shisei No Koe~ Autosplitter

An "autosplitter", to be used in LiveSplit and the Fatal Frame 3/ Zero ~Shisei No Koe~ game emulated on the
[PCSX2 emulator](https://pcsx2.net). This script allows game time to be viewed on livesplit. It also allows
you to view your points and film using [ASL var viewer](https://github.com/hawkerm/LiveSplit.ASLVarViewer)
**FOR TRAINING PURPOSES ONLY** (i.e., don't view these variables on actual runs!)

[Download LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org) to use the asl file.
 
# How to use it

 * Download the `varviewer.asl` file
 * On LiveSplit, right click, select `Edit Layout`
 * Click the `+` icon > `Control` > `Scriptable Auto Splitter`
 * Under `Script Path`, navigate to the `varviewer.asl` you just downloaded
 * Make sure your `Timer` and your `Splits` are measuring **Game Time**!

# How to visualize points and film

 * Click the `+` icon > `Information` > `ASL var viewer` to visualize the variables
 * The "Value Container" option should be set to "Variables", you should see the film options and "points"
 * If you don't see the variables, try starting the timer and check again while the timer is running.
